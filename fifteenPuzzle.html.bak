					Ed, Edd n Eddy is an animated comedy television series created by Danny Antonucci for Cartoon Network, and the sixth of the network's Cartoon Cartoons.
					The series revolves around three preteen boys named Ed, Edd (called "Double D" to avoid confusion with Ed), and Eddy. 
					They live in a suburban cul-de-sac in the fictional town of Peach Creek. 
					Under the unofficial leadership of Eddy, the trio frequently invents schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favourite confection, jawbreakers. 
					Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various, often humiliating, predicaments.
